<p>I remember I was 16, prepping up for the finals which would help me get a spot into the University. School in the mornings, studying in the afternoons, after school classes in the evenings and then basketball practice at nights. It was the first time I start thinking that I don't have time to do anything else.</p>
<p>In the University I had all the time of the world but still it was not enough. All day in the class, projects, midterm exams, finals and go on.</p>
<p>And then I got my first real job, teaching students Unix bash scripting and working for more than 20 hours per week. Still, no time!</p>
<p>And then I started to consistently contribute to Open Source projects like the Fedora project and co-founded Serres Linux User Group. Still, no time!</p>
<p>You get the picture, there was no more free time, right? Well, I am not sure anymore.</p>
<p>Only after 10 years I get to realize that there was always time. But there was time only for the things that I wanted, I loved and I cared about.</p>
<p>Let's run an experiment.</p>
<h2>Coffee anyone?</h2>
<p>Will you have a coffee with me in three weeks from now, on Tuesday at 18:00.</p>
<p>What do you say? Well most, of the people will say that they<strong> don't know or they don't have the time or to talk again in two weeks.</strong></p>
<p>Something that I have learned to trust over the years is my calendar. And quite recently I managed to surpass "my fear" of scheduling something in 4 months ahead.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a reason for being in my calendar and I am going to do it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Priorities</h2>
<p>The key for trusting your calendar is to learn to plan your day/week/month according to your priorities.</p>
<p>We all have different priorities but we all struggle to prioritize them based on their importance and our desires.</p>
<p>What would keep you away from scheduling a coffee in three weeks from now? Are you afraid of staying late in the office or generally that something might change your plans the last moment?</p>

<h2><del>Sir yes sir!</del></h2>
<p>It's time to start putting a little bit more thinking into our planning process.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it important? Is it something you would like to do? Alright then, let's schedule it!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have something else planned for that day, it's fine! It's not a problem turning people down because you have other plans.</p>
<p>We will dive more into the prioritization process and how to be on top of your everyday life in another blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Today it's all about:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Taking decisions based on your priorities</li>
<li>Surpassing the fear of planning ahead and</li>
<li>Learning to trust your calendar</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<p>So how do you feel scheduling a coffee or a meeting in three weeks from now?</body></html></p>
