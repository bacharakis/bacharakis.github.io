<p>We just came back from the annual “night beer fest” with Fedora company. It was really a great time with a lot of cool guys, loughs and some internal (Greek) flames. Today was the first day at Fosdem and I had the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people and generally FOSS hackers around the globe. For one more year the organization team of Fosdem did a really great job gathering people around the world at one place for two days. They also did a great job providing us whatever we needed.</p>
<p>In a few sentences I can describe fosdem as the biggest FOSS conference now days which brings hackers and generally foss contributors around the world in one place for two days. These days are really important because great minds get together, great thoughts are born and big things are happening. About today all the presentations were really awesome. In every room there was a interesting talk about almost everything. From the hardware, to the software and the human site of FOSS in general. Unfortunately I could not attend to as much presentations i wanted to but i make it to follow Spacewalk talk which was simply awesome.</p>
