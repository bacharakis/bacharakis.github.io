<p>This blog pos is refereed on a session whichÂ  I run in OpenSUSE collaboration camp 2012 with the title:"The Web is the Platform : Web Applications" and around 30 attendants.</p>
<p>In this session I had the chance to present what is a Web Application, why to build a WebApp and how to do it.</p>
<p>After explaining the benefits of creating and using WebApps online and off line, we explored some cool new features that HTML5 brings along with some of the revolutionary <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI">WebAPIs </a>that Mozilla develops.</p>
<p>That was the time to dive into WebApps and take a look in the process of creating a Web Application. For those who don't know, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Getting_Started">creating a web application is a really simple process </a>which can be described in 2 steps.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/08/DSCN7127.JPG" alt="" width="565" height="423"></p>
<p>Imagine that you have a "site" where you provide some services and you want to transform it into a WebApp. The only thing you have to do is to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Manifest">create the Manifest</a> which is a file with all WebApp's details regarding the developer, where is hosted, the languages which are supported and more.</p>
<p>In Mozilla's developer network you can find a detailed guide on<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Manifest"> how to write your WebApp's manifest</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an "installation" page for your webapp. This page can present some basic information regarding the webapp, reviews, critics and a "install" button for installing the webapp in your browser/device. The "install" button<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Getting_Started#Installing_the_app"> has a simple and clear Javascript code</a> which calls the webapp's Manifest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately web applications can not be installed in Linux based operating systems because all the different architectures that every operating system has. Mozilla foundation is working on that problem and I'm pretty sure that problem is going to be solved in the near future. MacOS is fully supports web applications instead of Windows where you have to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Platform-specific_details">perform some actions in order to install your web application</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally Mozilla is working on a <a href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/">Marketplace</a> where all Web Applications will be hosted along with reviews, screen shots, users feedback and a lot of new features.</p>
<p>As you see creating a Web Application is a pretty simple and easy task. The feedback from the session was very positive with a lot of people showing interest on messing with WebApps. The presentation file can be found <a href="http://htmlpad.org/OpenSuseCollaborationCampWebapps">here</a>, but due to the fact that it was something like a workshop, the slides are a generic.</p>
<p>Enjoy and don't forget that "The Web is the Platform". ;-)</p>
