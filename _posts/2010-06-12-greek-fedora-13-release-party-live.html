<p>In about 1:30 hour is about to start the biggest release party in Greece. I am talking about the Greek Fedora 13 Release party. The party will be held in Athens and Thessaloniki. The "two" parties will be "connected" through a video call. Additionally we will continuously upload photos spreading the pulse of the party.</p>
<p>You will be able to feel the rhythm by following <a href="http://twitter.com/fedora_gr">@fedora_gr</a> at twitter. Every tweet will include the hashtag "#f13grp".</p>
<p>So stay tuned and join the party!</p>
<p>More updated will follow :)</p>
