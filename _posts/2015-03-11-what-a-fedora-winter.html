<p style="text-align:left;">Hello readers! It’s been a long time since my last post. Apologies for that but I was working on <a href="http://codebender.cc">an online IDE for Arduino</a> with the rest of the <a href="https://codebender.cc/static/team">Codebender team</a>.</p>
<p>However I think it’s time to share with you some of my “adventures” inside the amazing Fedora world!</p>
<h2>OSOL Conference Szeged</h2>
<p>In November I was invited by the Hungarian community to attend their yearly national FOSS conference named <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OSOL_Conference_Szeged">OSOL Szeged 2014</a>.</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience since I had the opportunity to meet in person the awesome local Fedora community and have a presentation to OSOL event on the upcoming Fedora products. Thank you <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Levex">Levex</a> for organizing the presence of the Fedora Project in OSOL Szeged<br />

It was one of the moments where I really enjoyed my presentation since I received a lot questions and had some interesting discussions. And when you have a lot of questions you know that the topic of your talk was interesting and the audience was actually listening to you.</p>
<p>The feedback I received on our decision for dramatically changing the Fedora operating system and creating three different but more innovative products was really positive and encouraging.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the event and my whole trip was the energy of the Fedora Hungarian community. I consider them as one of the most active FOSS (not only in Fedora) communities in Europe who focus on actual contributions and not only on running events.</p>
<p>During my stay I had the opportunity to brainstorm with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rgeri77">Gergely</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Zoltanh721">Zoltan</a> on how to sustain large and highly active FOSS communities. We also discussed the agenda of the upcoming Fedora Ambassadors EMEA meeting in Germany where I represented both Greece and Hungary since non of the Hungary community members was able to attend.</p>
<p>Last but not least I want to thank Gergely for having me in his home and make me feel like part of his beautiful family! Honestly this is something that cannot be described with words.</p>
<h2>FAD Rheinland 2014</h2>
<p>FAD are the initials for the Fedora Activity day, a day dedicated to the Fedora project. Actually in <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Rheinland_2014">Leverkusen</a> we had two days with activities dedicated on the Ambassador program with people joining from almost all the Fedora European communities.<br />
<img class="alignright" title="developer" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2015/03/16035954307_91fba58a3b_b.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="614"><br />
After the introductions and presenting the current status of each community we reviewed in detail all the important events in the EMEA region for the year 2015. As a result we could be more accurate on our yearly budget. We decided to focus on events with certain audience and more technical topics where we believe the audience of our three products (Workstation, Cloud, Server) exists.</p>
<p>Swag production was in the agenda (as always ;) ) and we reviewed some of the existing or new ideas on producing swag. However I am sorry but I can't share more with you, it’s a surprise!</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the event was the conference call with our new Fedora project leader Matthew Miller who walked on the same path for focusing on specific and more technical events where we can engage more active contributors with Fedora.</p>
<p>I left the event with a lot of pleasant memories and thoughts since I spent a weekend with my Fedora friends. I was really happy seeing old and good friends and meeting new ones, people who joined the Fedora Project recently and they are already active and contributing in their area of expertise.</p>
<p>Until the next time my Fedora friends.</p>
