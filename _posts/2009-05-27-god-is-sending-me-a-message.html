<p>Yesterday the day was dedicated to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2">NSLU2</a> device (aka slougaki). I wanted to install and set up a decent Linux distribution such as Debian. Unfortunately it doesn't support fedora :(. After a long time process (about 5 hours) I was able to login to my brand new installation.</p>
<p>ssh cmpahar@192.168.1.73</p>
<p>cmpahar@192.168.1.72's password:</p>
<p>cmpahar@matina-PC:~$</p>
<p>/me shocked</p>
<p>As you can see my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2">NSLU2's</a> name is matina-PC although during the installation I put "malta". The other weird thing is that "matina" is my x-girlfriend's name. I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>Let's  # cat hosts</p>
<p>cmpahar@matina-PC:~$ cat /etc/hosts<br />
127.0.0.1    localhost<br />
127.0.1.1    matina-PC.lan    matina-PC</p>
<p># The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts<br />
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback<br />
fe00::0 ip6-localnet<br />
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix<br />
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes<br />
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters<br />
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts</p>
<p>I don't now what exactly happened! My x-girlfriend is a super ninja and tries to revenge me or God is sending me a message?</p>
<p>Although you have to be carefull, evil divorced ninja women are out there..</p>
