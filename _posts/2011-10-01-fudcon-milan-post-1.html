<p>Good morning from Milan!</p>
<p>I am really excited attending my third <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Milan_2011">FUDCon</a> especially in the beautiful city of Milan.</p>
<p>For those who have no idea what is <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon">FUDCon just take a look to the following link.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="FUDCon t-shirt and badge" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2011/10/scaled.php?tn=0&amp;server=612&amp;filename=8dlyj.jpg&amp;xsize=640&amp;ysize=640" alt="" width="640" height="383">Yesterday was unofficially the first day of Fudcon with some sightseeing, a lot of free food and a lot of mojitos! Fortunately we could wake up this morning for the officially first day of the event.</p>
<p>After a small talk from Jared Smith our Project leader, anyone who wanted to make a presentation, took a paper, wrote his idea and <a href="http://yfrog.com/g03yvoxj">stood up to explain his idea/project</a>.</p>
<p>Later on everyone took a pen and voted the presentations he wanted to attend in order to create a fair schedule with 5 parallel sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Voting Presentations" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2011/10/4w1lw.jpg" alt="" width="746" height="447"></p>
<p>I am stop blogging to attend some cool presentations.</p>
<p>That's the <a href="http://yfrog.com/nxs3uabj">schedule for the next 2 hours.</a></p>
<p>Till my next blog post you can view the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23fudcon">twitter stream</a> of the event for the latest updates!</p>
