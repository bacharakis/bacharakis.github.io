<p>Trying to follow the Fedora's 13 moto "Rock it" i am traveling to Athens to catch up the rest of the Greek Fedora ambassadors to represent Fedora project at a two days FOSS conference called <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraEvents/OpenFest_2010">OpenFest</a>. During the weekend we will have the opportunity to discuss some major topics such as a localized forum for Fedora and general our next moves inside Greece. As always Fedora will have a talk from Kostas introducing Fedora 13 new futures-Fedora community and as always, a cool booth. Pierros, Kostas, Anastasis and Thalia have done a great job burning 300+ Fedora 12 Live cds, printing posters, coffee cups, creating/printing some Fedora cheat cubes and so many others goodies! Thank you guys. Additionally we are determined to complete the Greek translations for the Fedora 13 release. That's why we are organizing a Fedora translation marathon which will be a parallel event inside Openfest. It is a good opportunity to show the people how is the leading force in Greece works and to find new translators/contributors! That's all for now. I'll keep you posted from my <a href="http://twitter.com/bacharakis">twitter account</a> and I will write about my experiences after the event. Till then, happy hacking :)</p>
