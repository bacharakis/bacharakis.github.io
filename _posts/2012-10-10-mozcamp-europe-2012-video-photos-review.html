<p>It's been a month since MozCamp in Warsaw and I am really happy that I am finally available to write a blogpost!</p>
<p>I always enjoy attending awesome events regarding open source along with brilliant people such as MozCamp, FudCon, Fosdem etc.</p>
<p>MozCamp was definitely one of them especially dude to the fact that I had the chance to chat and brainstorm with a lot of smart people around the world. Everyone was interested to get know you, to learn what are you up to and help you where ever they could.</p>
<p>When I find some I will publish some more detailed blogposts regarding some special topics on MozCamp such as Firefox OS, WebMaker and Mozilla Reps.</p>
<p>Till then, enjoy the <a href="https://vimeo.com/49453681">Firefox dance</a> at the closing speech on Sunday and <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/105770476640273513358/MozCampEurope2012">my set of photos on picasa</a>.</p>
