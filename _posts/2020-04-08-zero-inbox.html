<p>It's been five months, and my inbox is still zero. Yes, every day, by the end of the day, my inbox is zero. Jealous already? Alright, let's dive into it.</p>
<p>I have organized my inbox, based on David Allen's recommendations from his best-seller book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?s=amazon-devices&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526679771&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Getting+things+done">getting things done</a>. I was also inspired by <a href="https://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more">this article</a> that a great colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/kelimuttu">Kiki</a> thought I might find it useful.</p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inbox</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am using my incoming email folder for just reviewing the emails and placing them to the relevant folders.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Folders: <strong>Needs Action/Reply, Awaiting Reply, Scheduled, Delegated</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":774,"sizeSlug":"large"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020/04/zero-inbox1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-774"></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 3' Rule</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When an email includes an action that will take less than 3 minutes, I am going to do it. If the action needs to be delegated, I am going to place the email to the <strong>Delegated</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If the email requires a or multiple actions that will take more than 3' I will put it into the folder called <strong>Needs Action/Reply.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I delegate an action item to someone (not necessarily the specific email), I put it in the <strong>Delegated</strong> folder, to keep an eye and make sure that I am still on top of this, even after a month. Similarly, when I send/reply to an email, and I am expecting a response, I am putting it to the <strong>Awaiting Reply folder</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since my inbox should not be a place to store files or information, in case there are emails that I need to keep somewhere handy, I put them into the <strong>Scheduled</strong> folder.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Checking your email</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Checking your inbox all the time won't give help you be more effective or efficient. I am trying to check and triage my inbox only 5-6 times per day, which is still a lot, but due to the nature of my work (my colleagues are distributed around the world), I need to send emails all day.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deleting emails</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your inbox is not a place for storing information or tracking your tasks. If an email is not in any of the previously mentioned folders, it should be either archived or deleted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking action</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Around three times per day, I am reviewing the <strong>Needs Action/Reply</strong> folder, and I either move the action items to a relevant (to each project) project management tool, or I prioritize them. Every time an email is moved or tackled, I archive it or delete it. There is no need to keep it in my inbox or at least in a visible place that creates stress every time I open my email.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It sounds, and it's indeed simple to stay on top of your email and remove the stress caused by thousand of unread emails. Give it a try and let me know if that works for you.</p>
