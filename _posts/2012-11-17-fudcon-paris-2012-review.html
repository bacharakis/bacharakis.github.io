<p>This year was time for a beloved city to host our annual <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Paris_2012">FUDCon in EMEA</a>. A beloved city with a great community which organized an awesome FUDCon!</p>
<p>This FUDCon had everything and I mean <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Paris_2012_Schedule">everything</a>!</p>
<p>Marketing, awesome presentations, technical presentations and workshops, swag production (yeah!) and a lot of brainstorming hackfests!</p>
<p><!--more--><strong>The first day</strong> we was part of the "World Open Forum" where we had the opportunity get in touch with contributor from other FOSS projects. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Rbergero">Robyn's</a> keynote was quite awesome, explaining what is FUDCon, presenting the Project, the community, our new tools and some future plans.<img class="aligncenter" title="robyn" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/11/DSCN8831.JPG" alt="" width="483" height="362"></p>
<p>After that it was time for some more technical presentations where I had the chance to attend <a href="http://blog.famillecollet.com/">Remi's</a> workshop regarding packaging. Then I enjoyed Pierre's talk about Fedora infrastructure's new cool projects and tools. The highlight of the day was <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cwickert">Christoph</a>'s talk on leadership who tried to analyze with success the difference between authority and power in FOSS projects.</p>
<p>And the first day ended with a lot of beers and Pizza, the annual FUDCon food where I had the chance to eat for the first time in my life, pizza with chocolate! There I had the chance to catch up with old friends and make new ones! Now I have to warn you: "Watch out for the Hungarian community! They rock!". I totally love those guys! <img class="aligncenter" title="pizza time" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/11/DSCN8958.JPG" alt="" width="495" height="371"></p>
<p><!--more--><strong>On Saturday</strong> - this time in our own venue which was AMAZING - was time for the Barcamp! Everyone who wanted to make a presentation or workshop, grabbed a paper, wrote down their title and had some second standing in front of us presenting their idea! Then we took a pen and marked every presentation we would like to attend. After organizing a schedule the sessions started!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="vol" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/11/DSCN9123.JPG" alt="" width="269" height="359"></p>
<p>There I had the chance to attend in a lot of interesting sessions such as the Fedora User Experience by <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Spot">Spot</a>, Websites from <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Shaiton">Kevin</a> and Delta Cloud API. But the most brainstorming session was the "Ambassadors: Mentoring and other stuff" held by <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Paris_2012_Schedule">Fabian</a>. Along with other Ambassadors we discussed details regarding the Fedora Ambassadors mentoring process and the fact that there are few mentors handling a large amount of requests. That's why Christoph proposed six new Ambassadors (including me) who can help out in the Mentoring process! I am really happy with my new role and more happy that I am already mentoring a new contributor!</p>
<blockquote><p>Before that session, I had my Mozilla's hat and run a lighting talk regarding Web Applications, Firefox Marketplace and how could someone install web apps as native apps in Fedora.</p></blockquote>
<p>At evening, along with the rest of the Greek and Cyprus community we enjoyed a French meal in Montmarte area, in a small but very warm and sweet restaurant.</p>
<p><!--more--><strong>Monday</strong> was a hackfest day where I had the chance to work with pingu on the new event system and build an interface for that. I am still working on that. :)</p>
<p>In addition we had a swag production workshop where we decided about the swag we are going to produce for EMEA (baseball hats, mugs)!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="hackfest" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/11/DSCN9236.JPG" alt="" width="463" height="347"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the first time after Brno that I saw the hackfest room full with passionate people working with determination on their favourite project. It was simply amazing!</p>
<p>After the group photo I left FUDCon for the airport with bitter emotions. Thank you French community and fellow Fedora contributors for this amazing event!</p>
