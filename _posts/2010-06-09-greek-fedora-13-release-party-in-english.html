<p>We think that is the perfect Fedora release to organize a special and unique release event. That's right! For us (Greek people) is the lucky 13!</p>
<p>This Saturday we are organizing one release party that will be placed in the two largest cities in Greece. The release parties will be parallel, both starting in 18:00 (GMT +3) and they will be connected through a video call.</p>
<p>Additionally pictures will be posted online during the release event so the people that couldn't make it, can feel the pulse! You can stay tuned from the Greek community's twitter account at http://twitter.com/fedora_gr . We will also use the hashtag "#f13grp" in every tweet.</p>

<p>In the events, will be presentations regarding the brand new Fedora 13's features, future steps of the Greek Fedora community but in general we are going to have fun!!</p>
<p>If you will be around Athens or Thessaloniki, don't miss our party! We will have chocolate cake, drinks, live CDs, flyers, stickers, our laptops and a lot of blue balloons and of course support for you problems!</p>
<p>Follow the directions (in greek) to join us at http://bit.ly/f13grpm</p>
<p>We are waiting for you!</p>
