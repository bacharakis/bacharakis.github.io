<p>I am thrilled! This Saturday (30/01) at 12:00, the first <a href="http://wordcamp.gr/">Greek WordCamp</a> is taking place here at Thessaloniki city at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Mandrino+hotel+thessaloniki&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=57.815136,114.169922&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Mandrino+hotel&amp;hnear=Thessalonika,+Greece&amp;ll=40.635418,22.954473&amp;spn=0.027454,0.055747&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=12280239323453307341">Mandrino Hotel</a>. It a good opertunity for people they don't know Wordpress to come and get know the platform, the people who are behind, the community and generally all the goodies.</p>
<p>It is also a good opertunity for the Greek hackers to come and have some fun hacking and brainstorming around wordpress platform. It is an experience that you can't miss. Many smartÂ people will be there presenting and promoting wordpress.</p>
<p>See you there.</p>
