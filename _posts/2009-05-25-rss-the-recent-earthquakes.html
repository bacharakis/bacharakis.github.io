<p>Today I experienced two earthquakes, and it was little bit scary. It was like my home was dancing but without the music combined with heavy rain and thunders.</p>
<p>After the dancing I searched to find some details about the earthquakes and I came up with <a href="http://www.geophysics.geol.uoa.gr/stations/maps/recent.html">this page</a> that shows the recent earthquakes over Greece with some details. I find it interesting and very useful. You can also add the RSS feed from the site to your RSS reader.</p>
