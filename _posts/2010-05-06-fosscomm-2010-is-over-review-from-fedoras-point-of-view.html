<p>Fosscomm 2010 is over!</p>
<p>The previous weekend (24-25/4) in Thessaloniki, Greece took place the yearly FOSS Community conference - <a href="http://thessaloniki.fosscomm.gr">FossComm 2010</a> which is right now the biggest FOSS conference in Greece. <a href="http://fedoraproject.gr">Greek Fedora team</a> was there and had a great time and presence.<br />

In the last months Greek Fedora community is very active with a lot of adds especially in the translations and Ambassador team. That's why in every foss event in Greece we have the best and active presence.<br />
In last year's FossComm, Fedora's booth had three ambassadors/contributors, one translator and one friend of us who is now a member of the marketing team. This year our booth was way bigger with 7 ambassadors/contributors one contributor from the marketing team, one female translator and one beautiful girl who is helping continuously fedora without being registered anywhere.<br />
The conference was successful with about 500 people attending. What a wonderful chance to inform people about Fedora, our new Greek Fedora forum and find new contributors.<br />
Our booth had everything, the usual LiveCDs and install DVDs, many flyers, fedora stickers, fedora buttons, cheat cubes and 2 fedora coffee cups. I am very thrilled about the passion of our new contributors who gave their best to inform the people and present Fedora 13's new futures. By numbers we gave a lot of live CDs (250), flyers (130), swag and we earned 3 new translators and one marketing guy.</p>

In FossComm now, Fedora had one talk and one workshop. The talk had the title "Fedora fails and that a good thing" and made by me and <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr">Pierros Papadeas</a>. In the talk <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr">Pierros</a> had the role of the Fedora as an operating system and I had the role of the Fedora Community. We introduced the fedora architecture and we explained that even when &amp; if we fail our infrastructure is such well organized and build that the fail turns into a good thing about the Fedora project. With other words we present our perfect governance. The audience gave us very positive feedback and that pleased us.<br />
In the workshop <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr">Pierros Papadeas</a> impressed the audience presenting Fedora 13's new futures. I have to admit that his presentation was (as always) amazing, encouraging new people to give a try to Fedora 13.</p>
<p>In the end i am pretty sure that Fedora had another successful presence in FossComm 2010. Well done guys, you did an excellent job. Way to go!</p>
<p>I want to admit that I spent little time in the Fedora booth because I was FossComm's 2010 event organizer and I had many responsibilities. :)</p>
