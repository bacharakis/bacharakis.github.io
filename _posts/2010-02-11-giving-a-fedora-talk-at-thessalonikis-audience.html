<p>I am extremely happy! The past week, <a href="http://greeklug.gr">GreekLUG</a> invited me to give some talks about Fedora and i was instantly responded. That's why this Sunday at 18:00Â  I will have a presentation at <a href="http://uom.gr">University of Macedonia</a>, about Fedora as an operating system. After the talk the attendances will experience the new cool futures of the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_12_Announcement">Fedora 12</a> release.</p>
<p>Probably next week the same day and time I will give a second talk about Fedora as a community and let the people who will attend to experience the magic of the Fedora community.</p>
<p>Additional <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr">Pierros Papadeas </a>gave me <a href="http://dimitris.glezos.com">Glezos</a>' <a href="http://olpc.com/">OLPC</a> (I am very happy about that) for presenting it to north Greece and probably I will give a third talk about <a href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/">Sugar</a> spin.</p>
<p>More announcements will be announced soon!</p>
