<p>Yesterday I remembered that I have a <a href="http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/lbc/nslu2">Linksys NSLU2</a> device somewhere forgotten in a box.</p>
<p>Linksys NSLU2 is small Linux device which connects USB hard drives with the network transforming them in to network drives. It comes with a simple Linksys' firmware for performing only basic operations and changing some options. Although the device has an ARMv7 CPU which supports a lot of Linux ARM operating systems such as Debian and OpenWRT. You can explorer all the available operating systems available for NSLU2 at <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/">NSLU2-Linux's home page</a>.<img class="alignleft" title="nslu2" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/08/nslu.gif" alt="" width="165" height="132"></p>
<p>My idea was to use NSLU2 as a simple home samba server nothing more nothing less. That's why I choose to install OpenWRT <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/OpenWrt/HomePage">(installation guide available here)</a> which is light with an operational web interface where you can perform almost every administration operation you want.</p>
<p>After OpenWRT installation I faced two problems:</p>
<p>1. Couldn't locate the device's IP</p>
<p>2. The device didn't has DNS</p>
<p>The first problem was really easy to solve. OpenWRT is a small Linux operating system mainly for routers. That's why after the installation, OpenWRT has a static IP which is 192.168.1.1 which is the most common IP address for routers.</p>
<p>Now, if you try to plug the OpenWRT device in the network where there is another device or router present with the same IP (192.168.1.1), then you have a problem. You have to change your device's IP and let the OpenWRT device take 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second problem was a little bit tricky. In the first time I thought that the NSLU2 didn't have internet connections because I couldn't event ping outside the network. Through OpenWRT's web interface I visited the Network-&gt;Interfaces-&gt;Lan page where I was able to add the network's gateway where for me is 192.168.1.1 (my router's address). Unfortunately my problem was still the same. Suddenly I realized that I couldn't ping because there wasn't a DNS server.</p>
<p>Through Network-&gt;Interfaces-&gt;Lan page I added a DNS server field with the value 192.168.1.1. That's right, I added my router's IP address for DNS Server. Every other IP I tried to add was breaking down my DHCP server.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I have a fully operational NSLU2 device with OpenWRT installed!</p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
