<p>This is a little bit late blog post but I would like to share my excitement about this year's events.</p>
<p>Tomorrow around 12:00 in noon we are going to run a Fedora 18 Translation Sprint in Athens and Thessaloniki too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/09/db9f0-wearefedora-1024x724.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="383"></p>
<p>In Athens, <a href="http://hackerspace.gr">hackerspace.gr</a> is going to host celebrations for Software Freedom Day including a presentation for Fedora Localization and the Translation Sprint.</p>
<p>In Thessaloniki we are going to gather in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=40.63195&amp;lon=22.95185&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M&amp;mlat=40.63182&amp;mlon=22.95215">starbucks</a> for a Fedora Coffee having the opportunity to translate in parallel with the other Fedorians in Athens.</p>
<p>For those who can't join neither in Athens or Thessaloniki, they can join in the #fedora-el channel on Freenode server on IRC. From there instructions are going to be provided to join the Translation Sprint as well.</p>
<p>Happy Software Freedom Day, happy hacking and happy translations as well.</p>
