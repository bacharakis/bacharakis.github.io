<p>Today was the first day of Athens Digital Week and it was great.</p>
<p>First of all I have to admit that I was waiting more from the organization committee. We made them clear that this year we are going to be a larger team, with a lot of swag, laptops, events and many more. So we were waiting a larger booth in a central space inside the event.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have a smaller booth hidden in a small corner with the rest of the open source communities and foss companies. The only positive is that the talk zone is next to us. Additionally we got only a part of the swag that we ordered from the committee but at least we are thank full for that.</p>
<p>Well, I am going to experience the rest of the event and post my thoughts after the end of it.</p>

<p>So today after I saw a lot of good friends which I had a really long time to see, I wear my blue Ambassadors polo t-shirt and spread the word of Fedora! :D</p>
<p>In the open source section except of the Greek Fedora community there was also <a href="http://hellug.gr">Hellug</a> and the company <a href="http://ellak.gr">EELLAK</a>.</p>
<p>As said before, next to the open source section there is a talk zone where I had the chance to watch Samys Kamkar presentation with the title: How I met your girlfriend. What can I say, Samy was awesome!</p>
<p>After Samy I watched something like a round table around Mobile Security. Unfortunately a lot of the speakers presentations were containing only statistics and nothing more.</p>
<p>Day 2 is dawning so I hope for the best!</p>
