<p>Who told you that summer has no Open source events or conferences?</p>
<p>Greek OpenSUSE Community had the great idea to organize a <a href="http://www.os-el.gr/summercamp/">special three day event</a> in north Greece where every FOSS contributor was invited to attend, present and have fun.</p>
<p>The concept was unusual but simple. Wake up, swim in the pool, take a breakfast, attend some presentations, lunch break, swim, more presentations, dinner, night swim and finally beers by the pool.</p>

<p>Oh yes, this was really awesome! Despite the fun fact, the event was full will interesting and technical presentations. Here is the list of all presentations:</p>
<p>Friday:</p>
<p>Introduction to Plasma, <strong>LVM Best Practises,</strong> VServers, The new KDE features, <strong>How to create a community</strong>,</p>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<p>Developing with Eclipse, Mozilla - The Web is the Platform : Web Applications, <strong>openSUSE at ARM</strong>, MPFR, <strong>owncloud</strong>, <strong>The Puppet show</strong>, The filesystem hierarchy protocol, <strong>using LibreOffice for making good structured documents</strong>, Visit Prague,</p>
<p>Sunday:</p>
<p><strong>Setting up a booth How-To</strong>, Mozilla B2G : Bringing the Open Web to mobile devices, <strong>Trello - Organizing your projects</strong>, Gnome translation marathon.</p>

<p>The highlighted presentations were these I enjoyed most but i have to admit that all were wonderful :)</p>
<p>Of course Mozilla presentations were not highlighted because I run those sessions. You can find a detailed blogpost for each session.</p>
<p><a href="http://bacharakis.com/?p=432"><strong>The Web is the Platform : Web Applications</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://bacharakis.com/?p=436"><strong>Mozilla B2G:Bringing the Open Web</strong></a><br />
<a href="http://bacharakis.com/?p=436"> <strong>to mobile devices</strong> </a></p>
<p>Except the sessions we have the opportunity to discuss a lot of topics regarding the Free and Open Source in Greece, our next steps as a Greek FOSS community and how to motivate new and young people to join and contribute.</p>
<p>There was a moment in Friday night were Kostas Koudaras (OpenSUSE Greece coordinator), Thodoris Chatzimichos (Gentoo), Simos Xenitellis (Ubuntu) and me (Fedora) sat down and discussed without any hates the situation in Greece, our next steps as individual communities, our next steps as joined communities with common beliefs and generally ideas for motivating new people not only to join but to contribute (upstream) as well. For me that was the best "session" I attended because I had the opportunity to share my thoughts, receive a lot of feedback, give feedback and participate in a really intelligence round table.</p>

<p>From my point of view the OpenSUSE collaboration camp 2012 was really successful and I am looking forward to attend maybe a Greek FOSS community (OpenSUSE/Fedora/Ubuntu/Gentoo) collaboration camp 2013 just like the Greek Coding Camp some years ago.</p>
<p>Finally I the organization committee gave to each attendant a beautiful T-shirt and bag full with goodies as shown in the following picture.<strong> I want to thank Mozilla and Fedora Project for providing me with stickers, pins and CDs.Â </strong></p>

<p>Enjoy :)</p>
