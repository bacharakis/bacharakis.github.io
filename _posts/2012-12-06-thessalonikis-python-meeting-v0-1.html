<p>Last week we stepped out from the Greek Python mailing list in order go meet and get know each other.</p>
<p>Despite the awful weather and the cold, we managed to meet 10 people (BEAT THAT ATHENS - with two female people), know each other and discuss geeky staff.<img class="aligncenter" title="python meeting in thessaloniki" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012/12/DSCN0099.JPG" alt="" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>It was a great meeting and we decided to meet again and why not organize and event.</p>
<p>More info are going to be published soon.</p>
