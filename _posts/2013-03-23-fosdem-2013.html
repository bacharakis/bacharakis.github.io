<p>The first weekend of February of every year is always dedicated to <a title="Three weeks, three awesome events, one goal" href="http://fosdem.org">FOSS Developers Meeting (FOSDEM)</a> in Brussels.</p>
<p>FOSDEM <strong>is always a great opportunity to meet</strong> all my old <a href="http://join.fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> <strong>friends</strong> from around the world. Unfortunately I didn't get in time in Brussels in order to attend Fedora community's dinner but I met them afterwords in the Delirium Cafe enjoying a large variety of beers. Right <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cwickert">Christoph</a> ;)</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong> morning wake up is always tricky but along we <a href="http://roussos.cc">Nikos</a> we managed to get in time in order to <strong>prepare the Fedora booth</strong> along with Jiri where there was a surprising waiting for us as you can see in the picture above. Generally the most of my time I spend it in attending sessions but I did some <strong>contribution</strong> in Mozilla's and Fedora's booths too. This year's Mozilla and Fedora booths where <strong>better than any other year</strong> with a lot of new and <strong>passionate people</strong> spreading the word of their favourite open source project and <strong>seeking</strong> more and more <strong>contributors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was another great year</strong> with a lot of enlightening presentations, a lot of <strong>awesome</strong> and <strong>brainstorming</strong> conversations with <strong>hackers from all over the world</strong> and of course a lot of hacking. The discussions you have outside dev rooms with amazing hackers, the brainstorming and all this energy can't be compared with anything in the world. I want to give an extra credit to <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/fredy/">flash Fredy</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/panagiotis.bairamis.7?fref=ts">Panos</a> for having a live demo session in Mozilla's booth, presenting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> devices the whole weekend! <strong>You were amazing guys, thank you!</strong> Finally I want to thank all the <a href="http://reps.mozilla.org">Reps</a> who spend some time in booth talking with people, answering questions and solving problems.</p>

<p>As<a href="http://www.bacharakis.com/?p=555"> I blog posted before</a>, more than <strong>40 Greek hackers took over Brussels</strong> and FOSDEM where some of them run <strong>8 sessions</strong> regarding open source software, open source hardware, their awesome projects or the project where they contribute in.</p>
<p>But<strong> this year was special for me</strong> too because it was my first time <strong>attending FOSDEM as a speaker</strong>. At Sunday noon I had a session in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/mozilla/">Mozilla's dev room</a> regarding debugging<a href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/firefox_os_and_web_applications_debugging_made_easy/"> Firefox OS and open web apps as well as Gaia apps too</a>. Thank you <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/Clarista/">Clarista</a> and <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/benoit_leseul/">Benoit</a> for the excellent organization of the Mozilla presence. In general I think my presentation was a success despite the stress I had on stage. You can find my <a href="http://bacharakis.com/fosdem2013">presentation online</a> and you can always <a title="About" href="http://www.bacharakis.com/?page_id=123">mail me</a> for anything regarding debugging Firefox OS and Gaia.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>World, watch out! Firefox OS is coming and it's going to be astonishing!</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>FOSDEM 2013 is over and I cant wait a year for the next one! I am really glad for having a lot and great time with my old and new friends.</p>
