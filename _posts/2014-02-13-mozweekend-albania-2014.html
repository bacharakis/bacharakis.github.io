<p style="text-align:left;">This weekend<strong> I had the pleasure to</strong> experience the<strong> first Mozilla Weekend</strong> event in Tirana, Albania. They were<strong> two days dedicate</strong> to Mozilla, it's products, the community and of course the Open Web.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
It was my first time in Tirana and the first time I was meeting the<a href="http://mozilla-albania.org/"> Albanian community</a> in general. From the early beginnings, when<a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/elioqoshi/"> Elio Qoshi</a> first contacted me and invited me to the event<strong> I was able to see his passion</strong>. After I had the chance to <strong>meet the rest of the Albanian community</strong> I have to say that they all share the same passion. <strong>The passion of doing great things, the passion for knowledge and of course sharing their knowledge with other people as well</strong>. Let me try to describe the Albanian community with 3 words: <strong>passion, professionalism and hard working people.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter" title="groupphoto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2014/02/12463009835_91e3ff90b8_h.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="644"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So yes, the <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MozWeekend%20%23MozAlb&amp;src=typd">#MozWeekend</a> was a blast</strong>! The event was well organized in an amazing venue with a great content. The attendant had the chance to learn about<strong> Mozilla's vision about the open web</strong>, some of our amazing products such as Firefox, Firefox OS, developer tools and conquer the knowledge<strong> on how to create his first Open Web Application</strong>. And after creating his first Open Web Application he learned how Mozilla can <strong>help him on how to turn his idea to a product or a startup</strong> by signing up to <a href="https://webfwd.org/">WebFWD</a>. He also leaned how is it to be part of an amazing community such as Mozilla's, how to join and <strong>how can he help on keeping the web open and accessible for everyone.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="group" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2014/02/12428794303_ac61884d0e_h.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am really glad that I was part of the MozWeekend in Tirana because <strong>I saw the impact of the event in the attendees</strong>. I saw people's <strong>hunger for writing Open Web Apps</strong> and <strong>contributing to our mission</strong>. It was really amazing!<br />
Thank you #MozWeekend, thank you #MozAlb!<br />
Hope to see you soon</p>
