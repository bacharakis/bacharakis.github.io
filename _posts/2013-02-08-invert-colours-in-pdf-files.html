<p>Today I faced to following problem.</p>
<p>I wanted to print an ugly presentation which was stored in a PDF file. And I say ugly because the background was bright blue and the font of the text, yellow!</p>
<p>Printing this beauty in a printer will definitely empty all the ink in the first 10 pages. That's why we have to invert the colours in order to consume less ink in printing.</p>
<p>After an hour of searching on the web I came out with empty hands! I have only managed to apply a Gray scale on the PDF using the convert command:</p>
<blockquote><p>convert uglyPresentation.pdf -colorspace gray prettierPresentation.pdf</p></blockquote>
<p>I am still having the same problem. The background instead of the ugly bright blue is ugly black/gray.</p>
<p>So I started reading the man page of the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/convert">convert</a> tool instead of searching on the web. Finally I came up with the -negate argument which replace each pixel with its complementary color.</p>
<blockquote><p>convert prettierPresentation.pdf -negate beautifulPresentation.pdf</p></blockquote>
<p>And we are set! Now I can print my presentation consuming less ink!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion: Read The F*** Manual</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It is also well mentioned that you can invert or change the colorspace in other file types, like images.</p>
