<p>Great news for Fedora and the open &amp; free source community!</p>
<p>Today we (serlug) took the green light for installing Fedora to twenty desktops at our local University. The machines are located to our "computer centre" which is used from various students from various departments (not only computer science) who want an internet connection, to do a project, anything. We are also talking with a professor for installing fedora to two more labs at his department.</p>
<p>I am excited!</p>
