<p>This February was <strong>an amazing month full with awesome events</strong> regarding Free and Open Source software.</p>
<p>In the mid of the month I was invited in Bucharest in order to have a session in <a title="FOSDEM 2013 – review" href="http://osom.ro">OSOM</a> conference. OSOM (awesome) is the annual meet up/conference of the Romanian FOSS communities and projects.</p>

<p>This year there were re-presenters and presentations from the following communities: <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a>, <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, OpenSUSE, Java User Group, Ubuntu, Drupal and <a href="http://rosedu.org/aboutus/">ROSEdu</a>. All presentations were <strong>really interesting</strong> but I would like to choose <strong>Mozilla's</strong>, <strong>OpenSUSE's</strong> and <strong>ROSEdu's</strong> presentations where they were <strong>simply amazing!</strong></p>
<p>In this point I would like to give an <strong>extra credit</strong> to <strong>ROSEdu</strong> which is a group of people who <strong>promote</strong> and<strong> support open source in education.</strong> Way to go guys, keep up the great work!</p>
<p>During my <strong>presentation</strong> on Friday I had the chance to <strong>present the Fedora project</strong> and<strong> it's community</strong>. I presented Fedora 18's new <strong>cutting edge features</strong> and I put a special effort in our official <strong>spins and special interest groups</strong>. Romania was a <strong>challenge</strong> for me because except of my presentation I wanted to <strong>seek more active contributors</strong> along with the experienced ones like my best friend <a href="http://nicubunu.blogspot.gr/">Nicu</a>. I am really glad that I had the chance to spend to full days with him!</p>
<p>During the dinner after OSOM I was approached by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/teodora.baluta.7">Theodora</a> which is a young developer who wants to be more <strong>involved</strong> in Fedora's<strong> development process</strong>!</p>

<p>On Saturday, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/%40pensacolla">Marcela</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ioana_cis">Ioana</a>, the two girls that <strong>made OSOM happen</strong> and with the help of ROSEdu, Fedora had it's release party in the <a href="https://maps.google.gr/maps?q=Facultatea+de+Automatica+si+Calculatoare&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=44.43712,26.047425&amp;spn=0.007431,0.021136&amp;cid=4972015239425362466&amp;gl=GR&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Facultatea de Automatica si Calculatoare</a>. Along with Nicu, we had the chance to make a more detailed <strong>presentation</strong> of the <strong>Fedora Operating system</strong> and the<strong> Fedora wiki</strong>. We presented<strong> Gnome 3</strong>, some tips and tricks on that, Fedora Project's wiki, steps on <strong>how to contribute</strong> in a variety of roles, <strong>how to translate</strong> and of course some hacking sessions. During the hacking sessions, we <strong>hacked</strong> our <strong>raspberry pi</strong> installing Fedora, we presented some cool <strong>GIMP tricks</strong> and finally we had our<strong> rpm packaging session</strong>.</p>

<p>The attendances were 15 and except some Fedora users the variety of them was from other FOSS communities such as Ubuntu and OpenSUSE but <strong>In the end of the day they all had a fresh Fedora installation</strong>!</p>
<p>Speaking of new Fedora users lets talk about new Fedora contributors too. <a href="https://twitter.com/ioana_cis">Ioana Chiorean</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lakatos88">Alex Lakatos</a> expressed a lot of <strong>interest in contributing</strong> to Fedora project. Both of them are<strong> leaders</strong> in Mozilla Romanian community organizing A LOT of events and mentoring new contributors. Especially Ioana is<strong> willing to put a lot of effort</strong> in organizing and coordinating the Romanian community. I am really glad that I have the chance to mentor them in Fedora and watch them contribute in the project. <strong>Welcome guys and thank you</strong> for your effort! I am pretty sure that <strong>more updates are going to follow</strong>. ;)</p>
<p>Wrapping up my thoughts, <strong>OSOM</strong> was an <strong>excellent</strong> event where I had the chance to <strong>meet</strong> a lot of <strong>active</strong> and <strong>interesting</strong> FOSS <strong>contributors</strong>, see another perspective specially of open source in education, seek 3 new contributors and make a lot of friends!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you Marcela, Ioana, Nicu, ROSEdu and of course Fedora for make it happen!</strong></p>
