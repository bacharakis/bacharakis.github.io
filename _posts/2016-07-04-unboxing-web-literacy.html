<p>Maybe I am excited but I am also extremely inspired right now!</p>
<p>I just had a call with <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/akenyg/">Ake Nygren</a>, a librarian and fellow Mozilla Rep from Sweden. Ake is trying to raise the awareness of <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/web-literacy">Web Literacy</a> in his library by mainly organizing cryptoparties in libraries.</p>
<p>Swedish library system is a close digital environment which needs a lot and fundamental changes in it's roots for Ake's (and other fellows) efforts to start having impact.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blogpost though is to talk about his side project, putting Web literacy in a box. <strong>Oh yes, he wants to transform the digital world to a physica</strong>l <strong>one</strong>.</p>
<p>He is building physical boxes <span class="s1">equipped with remixable material and gamified recipes for mobile maker workshop activities anywhere, e.g. a library, a school, a youth center, an NGO etc. The idea is to build a mobile makerspace which can be run literally everywhere. The interaction with the boxes should spark discussions and reflections on maker culture, digital literacies and the world we’re living in.<br />
</span></p>
<p>You can read the complete description <a href="http://mymakerboxes.tumblr.com/mobilemakerspace">of his initiative here</a> and check his activity in <a href="http://mymakerboxes.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>This is the kind of people we need, this is the kind of people we should be! Curious, who are never afraid to challenge themselves and people who never settle. And this is the way we need to start thinking, by having a broader vision, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">adapting the "hacking" culture</a> and looking for opportunities which will help us implement our vision.</p>
