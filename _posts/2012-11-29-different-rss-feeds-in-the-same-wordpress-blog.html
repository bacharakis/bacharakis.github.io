<p>Recently I joined the <a href="http://reps.mozilla.org">Mozilla Reps</a> program where there is <a href="http://planet.mozillareps.org/">http://planet.mozillareps.org/</a> which an aggregator for all Mozilla Rep's blogs.</p>
<p>In addition as a <a href="http://join.fedoraproject.org">Fedora Contributor</a> my blog posts show up in the <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">http://planet.fedoraproject.org</a> which is a Fedora contributor's aggregator as well.</p>

<p>The issue I had is that some of my blog posts are referred to the Fedora Project and they don't have nothing to do with Mozilla. That's why I had to separate and aggregate/push my Fedora related post to Fedora planet and my Mozilla related to Reps planet.</p>
<p>All my blog posts had the proper tagging and have been categorized in different categories. So after some search the solution was quite obvious.</p>
<p>The RSS feed for a selected tag - mozilla for example - is:</p>
<pre>http://www.bacharakis.com/?tag=mozilla&amp;feed=rss2</pre>
<p>If I want to provide blog posts based on the category is could be like this:</p>
<pre>http://bacharakis.com/category/mozilla/feed</pre>
<p>Simple enough, right? There are more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds">hacks in this link.</a></p>
<p>So you can now provide as much feeds as you like based on the tags without worrying about messing blog posts in different aggregators.</p>
