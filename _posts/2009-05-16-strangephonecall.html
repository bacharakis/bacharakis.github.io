<p>Today at noon I had a strange phonecall from a guys who claimed tha he knows me. First he said "hi" in greek and then he asked me in english if I have a friend named Zacharum. I suddendly realized that he was actually my friend <a href="http://diegobz.net/">Diegogz</a> who is working in <a href="http://indifex.com">Indifex</a> (<a href="http://dimitris.glezos.com">Dimitris'</a> company) at Patras city for the last months.  He told me that he is in Thessaloniki and he is looking forward to meet me. Yeah!</p>
<p>Can't wait for tomorrow!</p>
