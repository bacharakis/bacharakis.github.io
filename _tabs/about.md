I’m Christos Bacharakis - a technologist driven by hands-on impact and a genuine love for building communities. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to lead strategic tech programs and connect people in places like Berlin, whether as Tech Relations Lead at eyeo, Senior Program Manager at GitLab, or Product Manager at Mozilla. My sweet spots are open source engagement, international collaboration, and turning bold ideas into reality through effective program management. I thrive on growing developer networks, accelerating product development, and finding common ground in global standards. Outside the tech world, you’ll probably find me playing basketball, enjoying a great cup of coffee, or exploring the outdoors. Above all, I’m passionate about bringing people together to create innovative solutions that make a real difference.
